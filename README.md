Welcome to Group The Tile!


<b>Group The Tile</b> is a single player puzzle game. In this game, your goal is to group tiles of the same colour and size to achieve the highest score possible. Featuring different tile colours, different grids, and a unique sketch art style.

To group tiles, simply click and drag to form a group of tiles that match each other in colour and size. Then, find another group of tiles with the same characteristics and repeat the process until you are satisfied with your selection.
You can then lock it in by right clicking or pressing enter and watch the tiles clear and chain. Your score will then be calculated and new tiles will be randomly regenerated.

## Game Modes

There are three different game modes to choose from: Classic, Rush, and Endurance.

- <b>Classic</b>: Given a set amount of time to group as many tiles as possible. The more tiles you group, the higher your score will be.

- <b>Rush</b>: Group tiles as fast as possible to beat the clock. The faster you group the tiles, the higher your score will be.

- <b>Endurance</b>: Group tiles for as long as possible without running out of time. Each successful clear will reward you a small amount of time. The longer you play, the higher the score you will achieve.


## Special Tiles
